Laia is a slave. Elias is a soldier. Neither is free.
 Under the Martial Empire, defiance is met with death.
Those who do not vow their blood and bodies 
to the Emperor risk the execution of their loved ones and the
destruction of all they hold dear.

In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each 
 dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation 
(the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the 
intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the 
faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is 
between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So
she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.

First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a
 private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of 
them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're 
unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. 
One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. And only the dead are above suspicion.
